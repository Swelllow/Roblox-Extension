## Technical Details

This extension works by interfacing with Roblox's web APIs to gather server information that isn't normally visible to users. It then presents this data in a user-friendly format and provides tools to connect to servers of your choice.

The extension requires the following permissions:
- Access to Roblox domains for reading server information
- Storage for saving preferences
- Cookies to authenticate with Roblox

## Privacy

Roblox Navigator only accesses data related to Roblox servers and your friends list. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information outside of what's needed to interact with Roblox's servers. All settings are stored locally in your browser.
